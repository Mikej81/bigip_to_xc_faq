BIG-IP To Distributed Cloud Conversion Frequently Asked Questions and Tips
==========================================================================

.. _disclaimer:

Disclaimer
==========

Please note that this FAQ document is intended as a general guide and is not exhaustive. While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, the rapidly evolving nature of cloud technologies means that specific details may change over time. Therefore, this guide should not be considered a substitute for professional advice or detailed consultation relevant to your specific circumstances.

.. _introduction:

Introduction
============

This semi-comprehensive guide is designed to streamline your migration from F5 BIG-IP to F5 Distributed Cloud.  This document aims to address frequently asked questions that arise during the migration process, offering clear, concise answers and practical insights to ensure a smooth transition.

Disqualifiers
=============

This is a list of use-cases that can be used to immediately disqualify a migration, with some caveats. There are service chaining use-cases that could still work, or ways to implement policies to redirect traffic to a BIG-IP instead of XC, or ways to inline NGINX into XC to carry out many of the same effects.

#. Access services that require Match Across.  https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K5837

   * DTLS - SSLVPN
   * PCOIP - (HTML5 BLAST works fine)

   .. note:: Most VPN Providers allow you to disable UDP/DTLS and force TCP, this works fine.

#. NTLM

.. warning:: With the deprecation of NTLM Announced by Microsoft, it is recommend that all customers move to Kerberos, if at all possible.

Tools
=====

The following are tools available to use today.  It's important to note that none of these tools are 100%. It is highly recommended to work with an XC Specialist to help in migration from other platforms to XC.

Access Policy Manager
=====================

APM services are not supported in Distrubuted Cloud today, but Service/Proxy chaining is supported.

.. note:: There are some workable use-cases around Federated Authentication and proxy/service chaining.


AWAF to WAAP
============

.. note:: While we understand that some organizations have spend years, and even decades tuning a WAF policy, the recommended best practice when moving to Distributed Cloud WAAP is to start with the default recommendations, and tune from there.
   Service Policies will cover traditional IP blocks as well as additional IP-Geo, and additional allow/deny rules.  

Web Application Firewalls (WAF) originally emerged to protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. WAFs primarily focus on defending against common web attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and file inclusion, operating according to a set of predefined or customizable rules.

The evolution to Web Application and API Protection (WAAP) represents a shift towards a more comprehensive security framework that not only includes all the traditional protections offered by WAFs but also extends coverage to APIs, which are increasingly used as the backbone of modern applications.

Be sure to evaluate ASM Logs for WAF activity to determing which, if any policies need to be migrated.

.. image:: ../images/picture17.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

Check ASM Logs for activity. 

The best way to streamline the AWAF to XC WAAP policy is to use Policy Supervisor.

Bot Defense 
----------------------

Bot Defense is likely to require XC Bot Defense Standard at a minimum, or Advanced. XC WAAP contains only Bot Signatures. A simple alternative could be XC JavaScript Challenge, which might not meet your security requirements.

Policy Supervisor 
-----------------

Policy Supervisor can be used to convert BIG-IP Adv. WAF policies to XC WAF policies. 

If you do not have access to Policy Supervisor, you should check out the guidance here:

Local Traffic Manager
=====================

There are very few disqualifiers for LTM.

#. Load Balancing services that require Match Across.

   * DTLS
   * PCOIP

#. Streaming Profiles. We do not support streaming content today in XC LBs.

   * E.g., Rewriting HTML page content.

#. OneConnect

DNS
===

Distributed Cloud DNS supports Primary, Secondary, and DNS Load Balancing.  The base format for zones is JSON/YAML, and in some cases cannot be directly imported.

APM to Distributed Cloud (Service Chaining)
===========================================

We covered the disqualifiers, but there are some that will work fine, like service chaining for Federation, or header validation.

API Security
------------

So secure...

LTM to Load Balancing as a Service
==================================

Most services will move to Distributed Cloud fairly easily.

Websockets
----------

Websockets are supported for load balancing in Distributed Cloud.  

https://f5cloud.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/18944650914327-How-to-configure-Websockets-correctly-on-F5-XC-platform

LTM as Upstream / Origin
------------------------

Occasionally there is a use-case where instead of a Customer Edge on-premises, you want to continue to use a BIG-IP.  This will work as long as proper preparations are made.

HTTP/1.1 & HTTP/2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BIG-IP by default uses HTTP/1.1 on profiles.  Distributed Cloud uses HTTP/2 by default.  It is important to ensure that the Origin Pool in XC is configured for HTTP/1.1 when the Upstream is a BIG-IP.

HTTP Keep-Alive & Connection Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Keep-Alive general header allows the sender to hint about how the connection may be used to set a timeout and a maximum amount of requests.

.. warning:: Connection-specific header fields such as Connection and Keep-Alive are prohibited in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. Chrome and Firefox ignore them in HTTP/2 responses, but Safari conforms to the HTTP/2 specification requirements and does not load any response that contains them.

Since keep-alive and connection headers will be ignored, its important to evaluate timeouts from XC to BIG-IP and properly configure timeouts in the Load Balancer and Origin configurations.

Timeouts can be configured in a a number of locations in the XC Console.

SNAT
^^^^

Distributed Cloud is a SaaS Platform.  BIG-IP is not.  Some applications may be configured to accept client source for persistence or other purposes.  Since the traffic will be proxied, applications been to be enabled for a more modern approach.


LTM to Customer Edge

SNAT Pooling
------------------

Today, XC does not support a traditional SNAT pool type configuration, however, you can scale SNAT based on nodes in a cluster.  So a 3 node cluster will have 3 IPs for SNATTING, if you need more SNAT IPs, then add more nodes. 

Traffig Group / Floating Self-IP
--------------------------------

To create the same scenario as a traffic group or floating self, you can use VRRP.  Check out Harmon's article here, where he discusses some of the CE design scenarios.  https://community.f5.com/t5/technical-articles/f5-distributed-cloud-customer-edge-site-deployment-amp-routing/ta-p/319435 

A byproduct of enabling VRRP on your cluster, and creating a common VIP, is that you can also use that common VIP as a default gateway. 

Custom Monitors
---------------

If you have been relying on custom monitors for routine tasks such as backing up data to an FTP server, sending email reports, or generating alerts based on storage availability. With F5 Distributed Cloud (XC), many of these functions are seamlessly integrated, thanks to our SaaS platform’s built-in scheduled reporting and alert capabilities.

However, if you need to perform a specific task that isn't currently supported by XC, such as invoking an API or executing a specialized function, we've got you covered. You can easily recreate this functionality in a small container script (for example, using bash) and deploy it as a scheduled task within our virtual Kubernetes environment.

For instance, if you need to activate a service policy or a network firewall rule at particular times each day, you can set up a cron job in XC. This job will operate on your schedule and interact with the XC API to execute your policies as planned.

SSL Transactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: ../images/picture3.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

TMM Client-Side Throughput
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sum throughput of all Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) and Packet Velocity ASIC (PVA) traffic on the client side. The following fields are represented in bits per second and packets per second: 

 - Client In: The sum of all ingress traffic 

 - Client Out: The sum of all egress traffic 

.. image:: ../images/picture4.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

TMM Server-Side Throughput
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The sum throughput of all TMM and PVA traffic on the server side. The following fields are represented in bits per second and packets per second: 

 - Server In: The sum of all egress traffic 

 - Server Out: The sum of all ingress traffic 

.. image:: ../images/picture5.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

Throughput
^^^^^^^^^^

The total throughput in and out of the BIG-IP system collected from all interfaces, including traffic processed by all Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) and Packet Velocity ASIC (PVA), except the management interface. The following fields are represented in bits per second and packets per second: 

 - In: The ingress traffic to the system through its interfaces 

 - Out: The egress traffic from the system through its interfaces 

 - Service: The larger of the two values of combined client and server-side ingress traffic or egress traffic, measured within TMM. You can compare this to VE-licensed bandwidth.

iRules
------

One of the first things to evaluate with irules, is if they are even being used. An effective way to gauge that is to check the Unused Objects under the Config Explorer. So, if you have 150 total irules, but are not using 102 of them, then that means we only need to review 48 irules, and based on historical evidence, I would estimate over 75% of those are just uncustomized redirect irules. 

.. image:: ../images/picture7.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

You can also see in the specific irules how many times its even executed (if its attached) under the irules Statistics.

   :width: 500px
   :align: center

Commands
--------

list /ltm virtual all-properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A straightforward way, other than reviewing the bigip.conf is to use the list /ltm virtual all-properties command and then search for “rules {”. 

IRules that can be ignored because it's a checkbox choice in XC are redirects: 

.. code-block:: text

   rules { 
        /Common/_sys_https_redirect 
   }

In the example QKView I am using, there are 670 instances of “rules”, and 468 instances of “/Common/_sys_https_redirect”. So, we have 202 instances of potential irules to evaluate, which is still pretty high.  But if we look at the irules, many customers have built custom redirects, which we can potentially ignore as well once we see they are just redirects. 

Let's look at an irule example, we can see it's in use, and has had 34k executions in the past 30 days. I'm sure someone will argue the point, but this is still a redirect irule. Or you could call it an apology page. It's setting the default pool, and if there aren't any active members, sending it to another page.  

.. image:: ../images/picture10.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

This is extremely easy to do with just L7 Routes, and custom error pages. 

In this qkview, there are mostly custom redirect irules based on host headers, over and over again.  This is a manual process, so be prepared to see a lot of redirects. 

.. image:: ../images/picture11.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

Then be prepared to see a ton of custom logging or header injections. Header Insert, Removal, and Appending can be easily done with the Load Balancer Advanced config, or more granularly via the L7 Route configs. 

In the case of this irule, it's just going to insert the header on every HTTP REQUEST. This is managed at the top-level Load Balancer Configs under More Options.

.. image:: ../images/picture12.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

From there you can add and remove headers to your heart's content. 

.. image:: ../images/picture13.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

If this irule had more logic, IF host header = this.domain.com, then we would use the L7 Route options. 

.. image:: ../images/picture14.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

show /ltm profile http global
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command will give you a quick snapshot of traffic with a virtual server with an associated HTTP profile. 

.. image:: ../images/picture1.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

We can see that we have had about 532 million requests across all virtual servers (over the last 30 days in this example). We can also see that there were about 71 million redirects. 

This data is perfect if we are evaluating an API use-case. 

UNIX - TMOS - tmctl -a (blade)
------------------------------

This gets us to the TMSTATS collections that span usually beyond the last 30 days that the RRD Graphs might show. Scroll down to the profile_http link and click it. This will give the aggregate values as well as every individual virtual server with a HTTP profile in a table format with column headers that are clickable to sort the data based on the values. Within this you will also reveal where some dormant virtuals are that do not need to be considered for migrations. 

.. image:: ../images/picture9.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

iRules
======

If not clear, any irules that are performing redirects, header additions, rewrites, or appending values are easily migrated to L7 Routes. If the irules requires things like binary scan, that is something XC does not support today. 

IRules that focus on Access Control based on evaluating IP blocks, client source addresses, etc., are easily migrated to Service Policies. 

RULE_INIT
---------

RULE_INIT is generally used to set some static variables for use in the rest of the irule, since we don’t have any programming logic in XC in order to take advantage of this, it can generally be thrown out, but pay attention to any definitions of data groups or things like that so you can understand the irules purpose; is it pulling domain names, is it pulling client ips, etc. 

CLIENT_ACCEPTED
---------------

Depending on what is happening during CLIENT_ACCEPTED this event may not be needed, or if there is some complex action requirements it will not be a good possibility for porting. Most customers use this to log client ip/prefix data, or select a pool based on an identifying client attribute, this can be done via L7 Routes.

CLIENTSSL_CLIENTCERT
--------------------

This event is probably not as common outside of mTLS use-cases, and in many cases is just used for logging, but also commonly used to create SSL Session ID's for Persistence use-cases. While XC does not support SSL Session ID persistence today, it does support mTLS, and it can extract the X.509 attributes and inject into headers to use for similar purposes. 

If we evaluate the following example:  

.. code-block:: tcl

   when CLIENTSSL_CLIENTCERT {
      set cert [SSL::cert 0]
      # Save the cert fields to a list
      set fields [X509::cert_fields $cert [SSL::verify_result] hash issuer serial sigalg subject subpubkey validity versionnum whole]
      log local0. "Client certificate fields - $fields"
      # Add the cert to the session table for use in subsequent HTTP requests.  Use the SSL session ID as the key.
      session add ssl [SSL::sessionid] [list $cert $fields] $::session_timeout
   }

We can use mTLS configuration to extract the X.509 Values. 

.. image:: ../images/picture15.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

Which we can then use for logic in the L7 routes. 

LB_SELECTED & LB_FAILED 
-----------------------

Depending on the use-case here, it's possible that we can supply simple solutions in XC to match functionality. Are you sending an apology page, are you redirecting, etc. 

HTTP_REQUEST 
------------

Depending on what is happening here, most irules are easily portable to L7 routes, excluding any collection or streaming. Setting, removing, and appending HTTP Headers can be carried out in several ways, including AND/OR logic for modification.  

Matching Host Header and URI Path Example using L7 Route Configs:

.. code-block:: tcl

   when HTTP_REQUEST {
     if { ([string tolower [HTTP::host]] equals "domain.com") && [HTTP::uri] starts_with "/xyz" } {
       node 1.1.1.1 443
     }
   }

.. image:: ../images/http_request_1.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

If the irule also does Host rewrites to the upstream, or path rewriting, this is also done with L7 Route configs.

.. code-block:: tcl

   when HTTP_REQUEST {
     if { ([string tolower [HTTP::host]] equals "domain.com") && [HTTP::uri] starts_with "/xyz" } {
       # Rewrite the host header
       HTTP::host "app1.domain.com"
       
       # Rewrite the URI path from /xyz to /lmn
       HTTP::uri [string map {"/xyz" "/lmn"} [HTTP::uri]]
   
       node 1.1.1.1 443
     }
   }

.. image:: ../images/http_request_2.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

.. image:: ../images/http_request_3.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

HTTP_REQUEST_DATA 
-----------------

XC does not support HTTP Collect or streaming, so irules that rely heavily on this event will not be a good fit. However, you can do service chaining with NGINX in vk8s to carry out the end goal in some cases. 

HTTP_RESPONSE
-------------

Like HTTP_REQUEST, this should be easily portable to L7 routes in XC.  For example: 

.. code-block:: tcl

   when HTTP_RESPONSE { 
      HTTP::header insert Strict-Transport-Security "max-age= 31536000" 
      HTTP::header insert "X-FRAME-OPTIONS" "SAMEORIGIN" 
   } 

HTTP_RESPONSE_DATA 
------------------

XC does not support HTTP Collect or streaming, so irules that rely heavily on this event will not be a good fit. However, you can do service chaining with NGINX in vk8s to carry out the end goal in some cases. 

ACCESS_SESSION_STARTED, ACCESS_POLICY_AGENT_EVENT, ACCESS_POLICY_COMPLETED, ACCESS_ACL_DENIED, ACCESS_ACL_ALLOWED, REWRITE_REQUEST_DONE, REWRITE_RESPONSE_DONE, ACCESS_SESSION_CLOSED 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since these are all APM iRules events, they are not supported in XC.  What we can do is evaluate incoming headers; MRH_Session, www-authenticate, etc., and make decisions on traffic. 

An Example of filtering unauthenticated traffic would be to create a route and filter on Authorization Header exists, or 401 Error from Upstream, and then provide a custom error page:

.. code-block:: html

   <html>
   <head>
       <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/dankogai/js-deflate/rawdeflate.js"></script>
   </head>
   
   <body>
       <h1>SAMLAuthnRequest Test</h1>
       <br />
       To use, modify the following variables:
       <ul>
           <li>var consumer = window.location.href; //Service Provider</li>
           <li>var destination = 'https://sso.domain.com/login'; //Identity Provider </li>

Logging
-------

Many customers use iRules to add more values to logs. With XC, many of the standard values are captured as part of the request and security logs by default.  

XC will automatically log telemetry data on platform, and can be connected to a SIEM via a Local (SYSLOG) or Global Log Reciever (JSON/HEC).  
https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/others/global-log-streaming

Let's look at an example that captures SSL Cipher and Version: 

.. code-block:: tcl

   when CLIENTSSL_HANDSHAKE { 
      # Identify the Client and negotiated cipher. 
      if {$static::payload_dbg}{log local0.debug "Connection from Client: [IP::client_addr] with Cipher: [SSL::cipher name] and SSL Version: [SSL::cipher version]"} 
   }

Another example that is common is logging all headers, which is another default in XC.  I have seen many variations of the following irule: 

.. code-block:: tcl

   when HTTP_REQUEST {  
      set LogString "Client [IP::client_addr]:[TCP::client_port] -> [HTTP::host][HTTP::uri]"  
      log local0. "REQUEST======================================"  
      log local0. "$LogString (request)"  
      foreach aHeader [HTTP::header names] {  
         log local0. "$aHeader: [HTTP::header value $aHeader]"  
      }

      log local0. "============================================="  
   }  

   when HTTP_RESPONSE {  
      log local0. "RESPONSE====================================="  
      log local0. "$LogString (response) - status: [HTTP::status]"  
      foreach aHeader [HTTP::header names] {  
         log local0. "$aHeader: [HTTP::header value $aHeader]"  
      }

      log local0. "============================================="  
   }  

Example Conversions in Terraform
--------------------------------

Standard http to https redirects are a checkbox in the UI but are also remarkably simple in terraform. 

Standard HTTP to HTTPS redirect: http_redirect = true

Customer Edge
=============

A Customer Edge is a Replica of an F5 Distributed Cloud Regional Edge, on a customer site.  It will fit into almost any form factor
and will extend the F5 Global Fabric to the edge location for use in multi-cloud network and multi-cloud application use-cases.

Sizing
------

Customer Edge Sizing can be simple, or not simple. Same as a BIG-IP, does it need LTM, APM, ASM, AFM, etc? HA?  Is the CE going to be used for L3 Routing / Mesh services only?  Will it need to run security services?  Will it need to run compute?

A good primer on deployment models can be found at Matt Harmon's article here:  https://community.f5.com/kb/technicalarticles/f5-distributed-cloud---customer-edge-site---deployment--routing-options/319435

Clustering and High availability
--------------------------------

Customer Edge Clustering differs from BIG-IP in that it is based on Kubernetes, and requires different 
architectures.  

Similar to BIG-IP in VMWare or HyperV environments, there are a couple configs to be aware of.

VRRP in a Hypervisor
--------------------

If you decide to enable VRRP for a cluster, the following should be evaluated.

* You must set the virtual switch's Forged Transmits and Promiscuous Mode settings to Accept. (These settings are 
  disabled by default). For information about enabling Promiscuous Mode and Forged Transmits on the virtual switch,
  refer to the VMware knowledge base article listed in the Supplemental section or in the VMware documentation for 
  your specific VMware version. F5 recommends that hypervisor administrators be very conservative with regard to 
  interface usage after you enable promiscuous mode. All packets are mirrored to all interfaces in the same 
  portgroup or vSwitch on which promiscuous mode is enabled. For each interface in the vSwitch or portgroup, 
  an additional hypervisor CPU is required to copy these packets. This can lead to CPU exhaustion for the 
  hypervisor, even if an interface is uninitialized on the system. 


* Starting from VMware ESXI 6.7, Promiscuous Mode can be replaced by MAC Learning in a supported environment, 
  that is, Promiscuous Mode can be set to Reject when MAC Learning is enabled on the vSwitch on which Customer Edge 
  VM is part of that network. The MAC Learning feature is supported only on Distributed Virtual (DV) Port groups.

* When configuring VRRP/Multicast for Customer Edge on Microsoft Hyper-V servers, 
  you will need to enable MAC address spoofing for the Customer Edge VMs in order for VRRP to work properly.


* To verify multicast is enabled issue the following command from each node in the Customer Edge Cluster.

  .. code-block:: bash
  
     execcli vifdump -i 15 -nnve vrrp and not host [ip-of-ce-node]

Troubleshooting
===============

Refused to execute script from 'https://exampl.com/Errors/GlobalExceptionHandler.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/WebResource.axd' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not executable, and strict MIME type checking is enabled.
